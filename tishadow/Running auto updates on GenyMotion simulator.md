In a terminal, navigate to the `tishadowapp` directory, and run

```
tishadow server
```

In a separate terminal, navigate to the directory of the app you want to run.  Run

```
tishadow run --update
```

Go to the emulator and open the tishadow app.  Enter the IP address that was showed when you started the server.  You should see the app you started, then, in the list.  Select it to open.
